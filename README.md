Nova Client is a texture pack that adds useful Modules to Minecraft Bedrock Edition

Nova Client is entirely ui based using no molang/player entity

## Building

Small tutorial on how to make an mcpack (if you somehow don't know)

If you want to build this project, you should use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

- Make the folder into a zip file
- Rename the .zip to .mcpack and import it into the game
